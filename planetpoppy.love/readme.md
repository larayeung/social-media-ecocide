# Welcome to Poppy World!

In this place, there are these things called tulips. They are... pink. 

# How do I see them?

Windows: 

1. Install love2d from https://love2d.org/
2. put a shortcut to love2d in the social-media-ecocide folder
3. drag the planetpoppy.love folder into the shortcut

Currently, it's not even a world of tulips! It's just bedrock.

Ideally we would have a few more layers of uh, existence.

We do know that there could be uh, soil on top of the bedrock.
