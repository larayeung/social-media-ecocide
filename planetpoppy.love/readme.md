# Welcome to Poppy World!

In this place, there are these things called tulips. They are... pink. 

# How do I see them?

Windows: 

1. Install love2d from https://love2d.org/
2. put a shortcut to love2d in the social-media-ecocide folder
3. drag the planetpoppy.love folder into the shortcut

Currently, it's not even a world of tulips! It's just dirt.

We do know that there could be uh, poppies on top of the dirt.

And on some of that dirt exists poppies. Right now they look like squares.

These poppies look remarkably like the ones from Lake Elsinore!

If you step on them, they die. This means that each poppy has around...two inches of space. In this place, an inch is equal to 5 pixels.
