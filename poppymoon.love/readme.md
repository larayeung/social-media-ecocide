# Welcome to Poppy Moon!

In this place, there are these things called tulips. They are... pink. 

# How do I see them?

Windows: 

1. Install love2d from https://love2d.org/
2. put a shortcut to love2d in the social-media-ecocide folder
3. drag the planetpoppy.love folder into the shortcut

so we made a moon to try to recreate planet poppy!

we can look closer at what is going on.

each cell is now the size of 1 pixel. each pixel is exactly 1 centimeter.

to avoid effort, we'd like to procedurally generate the other layers of stuff as much as possible.

starting off, we have a 1000 by 1000 dirt path.

we want a robot to... *plant* poppies onto that dirt path.

the robot is represented by [Bluerobin2's jetback robot art](https://opengameart.org/content/jetpack-robot)

that robot can be controlled by the arrow keys!

eventually this robot will plant poppy seeds
